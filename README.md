# AI 2D Animation Generator

This project is a web-based tool that uses generative AI to create 2D animations from a text prompt. The application is built with Flask and uses the Google Generative AI API to generate p5.js code, which is then executed in the browser to create the animation in real-time.

## Features

*   **AI-Powered Animation:** Describe the animation you want to create in plain English, and the AI will generate the code for you.
*   **Real-Time Rendering:** The generated p5.js code is executed directly in the browser, so you can see your animation come to life in real-time.
*   **Customizable:** You can customize the animation by providing a more detailed prompt.
*   **Interactive:** The p5.js canvas allows for interactive animations that can respond to mouse and keyboard input.

## New Demo

**Note:** I was unable to generate a new video demonstration due to persistent issues with the testing environment. The new version of the application generates animations in real-time in the browser using p5.js, and the video below is from the old version of the application.
